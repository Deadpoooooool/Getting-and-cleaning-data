# Getting-and-cleaning-data

Hi, thank you for reviewing my documents :) 

You can find out more about the variables in the dataset in the CodeBook file.

Information on the codes used to create the tidy dataset are stored in the file run_analysis.R.

I believe the tidy dataset will be presented to you as it was submitted via another link.

Kindest regards,
Tomislav
