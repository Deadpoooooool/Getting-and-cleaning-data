# Getting-and-cleaning-data

Hi, thank you for reviewing my documents :) 

You can find out more about the variables in the dataset in the CodeBook file.

Information on the codes used to create the tidy dataset are stored in the file run_analysis.R.

The analyses consisted of downloading the data, merging the datasets for training and testing and tidying up, all of which was step-by-step explained in the run_analysis.R file.

I believe the tidy dataset will be presented to you as it was submitted via another link.

Kindest regards,
Tomislav
